I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Virginia, co-advised by [Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/) and [Yangfeng Ji](https://yangfengji.net/).
I am a member of both the [LESS Lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/)  and [ILP-Lab](https://uvanlp.org/) . 

#### Research Interests  
My research interests lie in the areas of Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Interpretable Machine Learning. My work is focused on:  

- Robust and interpretable machine learning, focusing on representation learning for high-dimensional data.
- Developing scalable frameworks that leverage deep generative models to uncover meaningful latent structures.
- Bridging theoretical advancements with real-world applications across complex domains.
