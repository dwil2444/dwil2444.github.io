## Introduction  
Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the chance of events occuring. It is essential for understanding
data patterns, making predictions, and modeling uncertain events. In this post, we explore key concepts of probability,
including basic rules, Bayes' Theorem, random variables, probability distributions and more.


#### 1 Basic Probablity Rules

- Probability of an Event:  

The probability of an event, A denoted as **P(A)**, is a measure of the likelihood that event A will occur. The value of $P(A) \in \( 0, 1 \) $, where:  
* $P(A)  = 0$ means the event cannot occur
* $P(A)  = 1$ means the event will certainly occur.
